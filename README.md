- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install fzf`
- **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S fzf`
- **Windows (WSL)**: follow https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation

For other platforms and installation methods, see the official guide: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install -g ghfz@latest
```

Or use the latest unpublished version:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ghfz.netlify.app/run.sh)" -- https://ghfz.netlify.app/ghfz.tgz
```

## Usage

Once installed, run:

```bash
ghfz [command]
```

### Fuzzy Search

Running without arguments launches the interactive fuzzy search:

```bash
ghfz
```

You can search across:

- GitHub user homepages
- User repositories pages
- Individual repository pages
- Pull request pages

Type to filter and press Enter to open your selection in the browser.

### Commands

- **add**

  Add all public repositories of a GitHub user to the local database:

```bash
ghfz add
```

  Prompts for a username and fetches repos via GitHub API.

- **remove**

  Remove one or more users and their repos from the database:

```bash
ghfz remove
```

  Prompts to select users in a multi-select interface.

- **sync**

  Sync local database with GitHub for updated repositories:

```bash
ghfz sync
```

  By default, syncs only selected users' data. To sync all:

```bash
ghfz sync --all
```

- **auth**

  Store your GitHub Personal Access Token for increased rate limits:

```bash
ghfz auth
```

  Prompts to enter your PAT, securely saved in your config directory.

Use `ghfz --help` to view all available commands and options.

## Configuration

Your GitHub PAT is stored at:

```bash
# Linux
~/.config/ghfz-nodejs/github_pat.txt
```

## Data Storage

User and repository data are stored under your system data directory, for example:

```bash
# Linux
~/.local/share/ghfz-nodejs/users.json
~/.local/share/ghfz-nodejs/repos.json
```

Mock data is seeded on first run from the `MockData` folder.
